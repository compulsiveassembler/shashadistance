# shashadistance
just a little tool for a friend that takes coordinates placed in a csv file within the same directory, and calculates distance from that
using the Pythagorean theorem. 

Made when I was first learning Python. I'm not good at Python by any means, but I plan on remaking this so that the code is more idiomatic. 

**TODO:** Add option to pick from other maps in directory
          Implement party-tracking functionality
          refactor to idiomatic Python
